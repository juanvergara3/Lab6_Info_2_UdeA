# Orbits calculator

A very basic program that calculates plant orbits based on used input parameters.

It has features such as:
- Graphical interface.
- Animations (the program displays how the planets actually move).
- User input fields.
- Capability to calculate the orbits of several planets at the same time (and how each planet gravitationaly influences others).
